# ESRA: Explainable Scientific Research Assistant

The ESRA project is in a collaboration between _the Department of Computer Engineering, Chulalongkorn University_ and _NVIDIA AI Technology Center (NVAITC), Singapore_. 

Together, we create an explainable literature discovery platform by utilizing a knowledge graph and modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Our paper has been accepted in the system demonstration track at ACL-IJCNLP 2021.
